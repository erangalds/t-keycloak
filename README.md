# RedHat KeyCloak
Learning how to configure proper authentication and authorization meechanism in an application very important. Inorder to do that first we need to understand how the authentication and authorization works and what technologies are available for this purpose. OAuth2 came as a very popular method, therefore I thought of learning it and sharing what I learned. 

I found this software named ***KeyCloak by RedHat***, which has a fully functional community edition which we can deploy locally and learn. Therefore, this entire learning module will have *KeyCloak* Application as the base.
