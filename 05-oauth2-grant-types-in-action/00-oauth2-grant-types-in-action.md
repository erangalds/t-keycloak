# OAuth2 Grant Types in Action (with Python Examples)

Now, knowing the theory didn't give me confidence to say I understood the concepts. Therefore I wanted to built example apps and see how we can really implement these concepts. Let me show you what I build. Let's build python applications to demonstrate the different OAuth2 grant types. We'll use the requests library for HTTP communication and all authentication and authorization will happen with the **Keycloak** setup which I showed how to setup earlier.
